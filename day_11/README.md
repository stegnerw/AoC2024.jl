# Plutonian Pebbles

## Lessons Learned

- Naive approach was good for 25 iterations
- Compute time shot up beyond 35 or so iterations
- TODO: Recreate my initial approach, which was to iterate 1:25 blinks and go
  over the list of stones the whole time
- TODO: Look at plotting the time scaling of each approach
