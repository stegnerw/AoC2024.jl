# Advent of Code 2024

My solutions for [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024).

I am using Julia because I wanted to learn it.
**Do not** expect good Julia code here!
I have never used Julia before, and I am not spending too much time optimizing.
If it works, I send it!

## Notes

### Day 11

- Naive approach was good for 25 iterations
- Compute time shot up beyond 35 or so iterations
- TODO: Recreate my initial approach, which was to iterate 1:25 blinks and go
  over the list of stones the whole time
- TODO: Look at plotting the time scaling of each approach
